# Hello, Googlers!
### Please take a look at some of my code samples below.

- Please note that these are mainly small, personal projects.  So I would significantlly refine the code in each of the projects if I were to bring it to production.
- For a more refined piece of code that I've made in the past, there is a project I worked on that was more of a team effort.  However, the code for this project is currently private.  Please let me know if you would like a copy of this code.

## Now, here are my code samples!

### [1. Spark Implementation of GMM Clustering](https://github.com/yosukesugishita/gmm_clustering)
I created this as a mini-project for a class. It's a Spark implementation of gaussian mixture model clustering.

It's written so that the code can be distributed on a large scale.

### [2. March Madness Prediction](https://github.com/yosukesugishita/march_madness/)
I made a least square model for predicting winners of March Madness, the national college basketball tournament in the United States.

I built this model with different types of regularizations (L1 and L2), utilizing Python libraries such as NumPy and matplotlib. I ranked at the 32nd place out of 248 teams at the Kaggle competition.

### [3. YamBomb!](https://github.com/yosukesugishita/yambomb)
A colleague of mine at Microsoft and I created a gaming app with which a user would send a “bomb” that “explodes” in 24 hours unless they pass it to somebody else.

It started with a few users and organically grew to more than 70 users within a week of its launch. We developed the application with Ruby on Rails and Yammer API.
