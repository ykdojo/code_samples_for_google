# Hello Googlers!
### Please take a look at some of my code samples below.

- Please note that these are mainly small, personal projects.  So I would significantlly refine the code in each of the projects if I were to bring it to production.
- For a more refined piece of code that I've made in the past, there is a project I worked on that was more of a team effort.  However, the code for this project is currently private.  Please let me know if you would like a copy of this code.


# Now, here are my code samples!
